        "1. Performance: The win rate of 62.6% indicates a generally robust trading strategy, but the reliance on small wins suggests there may be an opportunity to identify conditions for larger gains.",
        "2. Risk: The largest loss of -10.51% and an average loss of -2.28% imply that risk management measures need enhancement to limit the impact of larger drawdowns.",
        "3. Improvements: Implementing a tiered profit-taking strategy could help in converting some small wins into medium or large wins, enhancing overall profitability.",
        "4. Market: The absence of large or medium wins indicates that the current strategy may not be fully adapted to trending or volatile market conditions; re-evaluating market selection and entry criteria may provide better alignment."
