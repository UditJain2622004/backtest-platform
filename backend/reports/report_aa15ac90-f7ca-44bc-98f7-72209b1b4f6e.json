    "insights": [
        "1. Performance: The win rate of 63.75% indicates a solid strategy; however, reliance on small wins (202 out of 204 total wins) suggests a conservative approach that may limit potential gains.",
        "2. Risk: The presence of a large loss (-23.28%) and an average loss of -1.88% highlights significant risk exposure; implementing tighter stop-loss orders could help mitigate these steep drawdowns.",
        "3. Improvements: Increasing the number of medium wins (currently only 2) could enhance overall profitability; exploring different strategies or trade setups to generate more balanced win sizes may improve results.",
        "4. Market: The analysis shows a predominance of small losses and wins, indicating a strategy that may not be well-suited for volatile market conditions; adapting to varying market environments with dynamic risk management and profit-taking strategies could yield better outcomes."
